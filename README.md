# Java Workshop Repository

Welcome to my **Java Workshop Repository**! 👋

This repository is a collection of all the code and exercises I am working on as part of my ongoing college Java workshop. As a student, I’m using this space to learn, practice, and document my progress as I explore Java programming concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Learning:** To reinforce and apply what I learn in each workshop session.
- **Practice:** To solve assignments and experiment with Java code examples on my own.
- **Revision:** To have a handy reference for reviewing core concepts and completed exercises.
- **Sharing:** To showcase my growth and help fellow students who might benefit from my notes and code.

## 📚 Topics Covered

As the workshop progresses, you’ll find code and notes for topics such as:

- Java basics (syntax, variables, data types, operators)
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and methods
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Exception handling
- File I/O
- Collections framework
- Workshop assignments and mini-projects

*Each `DayX` folder contains Java files for that day's topics. File names describe the topic or concept covered in the code.*

## 💻 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArpitRai30/Java.git
   ```
2. **Browse the folders** to find code for each day or topic.
